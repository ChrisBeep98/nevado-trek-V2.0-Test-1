  "about_text_1": "<strong>Nevado Trek</strong> was born in Salento, the heart of the Coffee Axis, with the mission of taking each traveler to discover the greatness of the Colombian Andes. Our team is made up of local guides who are passionate about the mountains and committed to responsible and authentic tourism. More than just tours, we design experiences that connect the traveler with the culture, history and magic of the trails that lead to the <strong>Nevado del Tolima</strong> and other hidden treasures such as the Cocora Valley and La Carbonera.",
  "about_text_2": "To walk these mountains is to enter a unique natural universe. The trails cross cloud forests full of mosses and orchids, and ascend to paramos where the frailejones reign, silent guardians of water and life. Each step is an encounter with changing landscapes: crystal clear waterfalls, open valleys and views that seem to touch the sky. Here, the flora becomes the protagonist and reminds us of the fragility and beauty of the high mountain ecosystems.<br />",
  "about_text_3": "On the way, the fauna makes itself felt with subtlety and amazement. From the majestic flights of the <strong>Andean condor</strong> to the vibrant song of the hummingbirds, passing through mountain deer, spectacled bears and small brightly colored insects that look like living jewels. These species are part of the identity of the region and invite us to experience the trip not only as a physical journey, but as a deep encounter with biodiversity. At <strong>Nevado Trek</strong>, we believe that every tour is an opportunity to reconnect with nature and rediscover ourselves in it.<br />",
