  "about_text_1": "Imagine a journey that touches your soul... That's how <strong>Nevado Trek</strong> began in the colorful streets of Salento, heart of Colombia's Coffee Region. We're passionate local guides who fell in love with these majestic mountains. We create experiences that let you feel the Andes – from misty trails to the mighty <strong>Nevado del Tolima</strong>, Cocora Valley, and hidden La Carbonera that most travelers never discover.",
  "about_text_2": "There's magic in stepping onto these ancient paths... Each step carries you into a living world waiting just for you. Wander through misty cloud forests whispering secrets, then climb to vast páramos where frailejones stand as wise guardians. Watch landscapes transform – from dancing waterfalls to valleys stretching like nature's cathedral toward endless blue skies.",
  "about_text_3": "Then come breathtaking moments... A shadow gliding across rocks – the mighty <strong>Andean condor</strong> soaring on thermal winds? The delicate hum of hummingbird wings as tiny jewels sip from exotic flowers. Glimpse mountain deer moving like ghosts, maybe spot the elusive spectacled bear. These aren't just animals – they're fellow travelers reminding us we're part of something bigger. At <strong>Nevado Trek</strong>, we live for these moments when you and nature become one.<br />",
