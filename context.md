# Project Context: Nevado Trek Landing Page

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Nevado Trek landing page project, including its structure, architecture, and the functionalities that have been implemented.

## 1. Project Overview

The project is a multi-page website for a travel agency named "Nevado Trek". The site showcases the agency's tours, services, and company information. It was originally built on Webflow and exported as a static HTML file with all assets hosted on a CDN. The project has evolved from a single-page landing page to a scalable multi-page website using a component-based architecture.

## 2. Project Structure

The current project structure is as follows:

## 3. Initial State

The project started as a single `index.html` file with all its CSS and JavaScript dependencies hosted on external CDNs (Content Delivery Networks), primarily from Webflow's CDN and Google Fonts.

## 4. Local Asset Migration

The first major change was to make the project self-contained by downloading all external assets and linking them locally. This process is documented in detail in the `method.md` file and can be summarized as follows:

1.  **Identification of Assets**: All external CSS and JavaScript files were identified from the `<link>` and `<script>` tags in `index.html`.
2.  **Creation of Local Directories**: `css` and `js` directories were created to store the downloaded assets.
3.  **Downloading Assets**: Each CSS and JavaScript file was downloaded from its CDN URL using a PowerShell command (`Invoke-WebRequest`) and saved to the corresponding local directory.
4.  **Updating `index.html`**: The `href` and `src` attributes in the `<link>` and `<script>` tags were updated to point to the local file paths.

## 5. Language Switcher Implementation

A language switcher was added to the header to allow users to toggle between English and Spanish content. This functionality was implemented through the following steps:

1.  **UI Implementation**: A simple language switcher with "ES" and "EN" links was added to the header of the `index.html` file, next to the contact button.
2.  **Text Extraction**: All translatable text from the `index.html` file was identified and marked with a `data-i18n` attribute. The Spanish and English versions of the text were then extracted into `es.json` and `en.json` files, respectively.
3.  **Switching Logic**: A new JavaScript file, `js/language.js`, was created to handle the language switching. This script fetches the appropriate JSON file based on the user's selection, updates the content of the elements with `data-i18n` attributes, and stores the user's language preference in the browser's local storage for persistence.

## 6. Layout Bug Fixing

After implementing the language switcher, a layout issue was identified in the marquee section when the language was switched to Spanish. The longer Spanish text caused the text to wrap and overlap, breaking the marquee effect. The following steps were taken to resolve this issue:

1.  **Problem Analysis**: The root cause of the issue was identified as a `min-width` property on the marquee text elements that was too large for the Spanish text, combined with a fixed-width parent container.
2.  **Initial Attempts**: Several solutions were attempted, including reducing the font size, using `white-space: nowrap`, and increasing the container width. These solutions were either rejected by the user or did not fully resolve the issue.
3.  **Final Solution**: The final solution was to override the `min-width` property of the marquee text elements by adding `min-width: auto !important;` to the `css/custom.css` file. This allowed the text containers to resize properly, accommodating the longer Spanish text without breaking the layout or changing the font size.

## 7. Multi-Page Architecture Implementation

To address the need for expanding the website with additional pages (tours, booking, gallery, contact) while maintaining Webflow styles and avoiding React (which would break the existing design), a component-based multi-page architecture was implemented:

### 7.1 Component System
1.  **Shared Components**: Created reusable components (`components/header.html`, `components/footer.html`) that can be loaded into any page.
2.  **Component Loader**: Developed `js/components.js` to dynamically load shared components into page placeholders.
3.  **Template System**: Created `templates/base.html` as a base template for consistent page structure.

### 7.2 Enhanced Functionality
1.  **Multi-Page Language Support**: Enhanced the language switching system to work across all pages with error handling.
2.  **Navigation Updates**: Updated navigation links to work with the new multi-page structure.
3.  **Translation Expansion**: Extended translation files (`en.json`, `es.json`) with new content for additional pages.

### 7.3 Page Creation Process
1.  **Webflow Export**: Export new pages from Webflow following the same process as the original landing page.
2.  **Asset Localization**: Apply the `method.md` process to localize all CDN assets for each new page.
3.  **Component Integration**: Add component placeholders and load shared elements.
4.  **Translation Integration**: Add new content to translation files and mark with `data-i18n` attributes.

## 8. Current Features

The website now includes:

- **Multi-Page Structure**: Home, Tours listing, and framework for additional pages
- **Bilingual Support**: Complete English/Spanish translation system with localStorage persistence
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable header and footer components
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Webflow's responsive framework
- **Smooth Animations**: GSAP-powered scroll-triggered animations and text effects
- **Interactive Elements**: Language switcher, FAQ accordion, tour showcases
- **Social Proof**: Certifications and testimonials integration
- **Local Asset Management**: All dependencies hosted locally for offline functionality

## 9. Scalability Plan

The current architecture supports easy expansion through:

1.  **Page Addition**: New pages can be added following the established pattern
2.  **Component Reuse**: Shared elements reduce maintenance overhead
3.  **Translation Management**: Centralized translation files for easy content updates
4.  **Style Consistency**: Webflow styles maintained across all pages
5.  **Performance**: Static file structure ensures fast loading times

## 10. Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:

- **Dynamic Content**: JSON-based tour data for easier content management
- **Build Process**: Automated asset optimization and bundling
- **Form Functionality**: Contact and booking form implementation
- **Image Optimization**: WebP format and lazy loading implementation
- **SEO Optimization**: Meta tags, structured data, and sitemap generation
